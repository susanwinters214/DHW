                      Texas is prone to severe storms that can seriously harm
                      trees, houses, and other buildings. Homeowners should take
                      proactive steps to safeguard their property and be ready
                      for the likelihood of catastrophic weather disasters. This
                      includes performing routine upkeep on trees and other
                      landscaping elements, such as pruning branches and taking
                      of dead trees. But even with precautions, extreme weather
                      events can harm people's homes and possessions. This is
                      why having your property inspected after heavy storms in
                      Texas by a home watch company like Dallas Home Watch is
                      crucial.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Residents in Texas must be ready for the likelihood of
                      severe weather conditions like thunderstorms, hurricanes,
                      and tornadoes because the state is recognized for its
                      catastrophic weather patterns. These storms can have
                      devastating repercussions, including power outages,
                      flooding, and property damage. The harm that severe storms
                      may do to trees is one of their most important effects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Strong winds, copious amounts of rain, and lightning
                      strikes during severe storms in Texas can harm trees and
                      make the environment dangerous for people and property.
                      Trees can be uprooted, their limbs and branches can be
                      severed, and whole trees can collapse or split in half.
                      Damaged trees can also impede highways, adding to the risk
                      of falling trees and branches.

                    <p>
                      According to the National Weather Service, the EF-3
                      tornado that occurred on October 20, 2019, was one of the
                      worst storms to impact the Dallas area when multiple
                      tornadoes that struck parts of Texas, caused significant
                      damage and unfortunately resulted in several fatalities.
                      The area's homes and businesses sustained substantial
                      damage from this tornado. Homes and other buildings were
                      damaged as a result of trees being uprooted, having limbs
                      severed, and even breaking in half.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Texas suffers from violent storms that do more than just
                      harm trees. High winds and heavy rain both have the
                      potential to damage roofs and cause water leaks in attics
                      and other parts of the house. Homeowners might not be
                      aware of the full extent of the damage until it is too
                      late because these kinds of problems can be challenging to
                      identify.

                      Part of being a Dallas Home Watch client, means that
                      professionals will come to your property to thoroughly
                      evaluate it following a storm. They'll be on the lookout
                      for any indications of exterior home damage, including
                      broken windows, damaged gutters and missing shingles from
                      your roof after damage from falling branches and trees.
                      They will also look for indications of water damage inside
                      your house, such as leaks in the attic.

                    <p>
                      Dallas Home Watch will inform the homeowner of any damage
                      discovered and offer advice on how to resolve the problem.
                      For example, you can hire a tree service to cut down any
                      damaged trees or branches, or you might hire a roofing
                      specialist to fix any roof damage. When you can't
                      physically be on site after a heavy storm, Dallas Home
                      Watch can be there for you to meet with contractors that
                      need access to your real estate property to remove broken
                      limbs or make repairs to your home. You can have more
                      peace of mind knowing that even though you are miles away
                      from your damaged property, you've got "boots on the
                      ground" being your eyes and ears and reporting to you on
                      the situation of your assets in Dallas.
